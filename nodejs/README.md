Final Thoughts
You're off to a great start! It seems like you've planned the major components and have a clear understanding of how to break down the tasks. By focusing on one thing at a time (backend or frontend), you'll be able to manage your progress and avoid unnecessary complexity.

Feel free to reach out if you need help with a specific part as you continue building!

1- homepage UI done - need to use api to import data
2 - create route so i can visit country pages
3 - basic ui for country pages
4 - create route so i can visit compare page
5 - basic ui for compare page
6 - connect api - update the home page with country name 
7 - connect api - update country page with api data
8 - connect api - update home page with other api data
9 - connect api - upddate compare page with api data 

i've done steps 1-5 with fake data (none of its from api's), i havent connected the api yet, what do you think of my plan below? 


all of below is part of step 6
- connect api in /backend/services/api.js
- make an api call to get the country names, use this for the title on the homepage
- use the country name to dynamically select the page on the homepage

- go to country page
    - make sure country name is dynamically updating 
    - make api requests for economic calendar event
    - add 'see more' button to see more data relating to calendar event
    - make api requests for maket data
    - make api requests for indicators
    - make api requests for forecasts

- check that this works on all country pages
- update homepage with some of this basic data as the basic stats for each country

- so now the homepage and country pages should both be showing dynamic data right? 

- compare page
    - use the api, to allow the uwser to select a country from the api for the dropdown when selecting data
    - use the api to make sure that when clicking between the tabs for events, market data, indicators and forcasts that it's all working properly for each country
    - if i have time create a chart










Hi, I had a very enjoyable time doing this, I had a few issues along the way. There is a lot more I wanted to do with this, in terms of graphs and tables, and what data is shown where. I only really used node and javascript, there were too many languages too choose from. 

In the future I can see myself implementing r or python and tableau to do some nice real time visualisations and data analysis on some of the market data. I've been watching cocoa, coffee and orange juice commodity index's over the last month trying to understand the increase in value, however I only had access to the 4 countries and not enough time. 

Honestly, it's been a year since I've used javascript, i spent one day making a website which i didnt like (nodejs copy folder - port 3001), so i decided to remake it (the nodejs folder) but its still not up to my complete standard. I would have liked to create a graph with live data and then use a function to update the color of the data either red/green to show increase/decrease. I would have also liked to split up my api/controller into more files making it neater and more organised. I would have also like to create a proper layout file that I could have used for the index, country and compare page (due to time constraints i told myself I had more important things to focus on and it could be done later). 

I can see I have a lot of room for improvement and I think I mostly know where i need to improve - validating the response in each function/file making sure its returning what i want before moving onto the next step. this has been very good practice and experience for me
